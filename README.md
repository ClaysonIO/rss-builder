# RSS Builder

This is a simple RSS feed builder for conference talks of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/). 
It's a simple tool to create a custom RSS feed based on a date and schedule.

After each conference, someone needs to go in and run `npm run addLatestSession` to add the latest session to the RSS feed.
I've tried to set this to auto-run using github actions, but it might not work. Please log an issue if you need me to run it.
